# Machine Learning Foundations

Hands-on projects to strengthen core machine learning concepts.  

Focused on experimentation to learn how models make predictions and how different choices affect their results.

## Projects

### 1. Titanic — Classification
Starting with a dataset to learn how to clean data, create useful features, and train basic classification models.  

### 2. House Prices — Regression
Exploring prediction using the House Prices dataset.  

### 3. ML from Scratch *(planned)*
Will build a simple regression model from scratch in NumPy to understand how predictions, errors, and model updates work.

## Learning Objectives
- Practice the full machine learning workflow from data preparation to evaluation  
- Understand how model choices affect results and performance  
- Build confidence through experimentation and clear documentation

---

## Current Status
In progress — working on the *Titanic* classification project and documenting results.
